## About
This project is a small landing page for a Plant Delivery Service, created as part of an assignment to practice building a web page from a provided design. The goal was to replicate the design as closely as possible while also adding personal touches, such as custom content and images.

- Responsive Design: The page is designed to be visually appealing on desktop screens (mobile responsiveness was not a focus for this project).

- Custom Content: Instead of using placeholder text, the page features content for a fictional plant delivery service, including a hero section, product details, and a call-to-action.

- Flexbox Layout: The layout was built using CSS Flexbox to ensure proper alignment and spacing of elements.
